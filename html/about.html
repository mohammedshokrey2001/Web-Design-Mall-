<th class="tt"><div class="pp">Shopping malls are really convenient because you have all the shops you need under one roof. Shopping in such places can also be more economical because you can compare prices at different shops since they are all so close to one another. If I am not at a mall, I will probably buy the first thing I see, without comparing it with something similar at another shop. Finally, going to a mall is fun because there are also cafes and cinemas there, as well as video game arcades. That means a shopping mall is a great place to go for entertainment with your friends as there are plenty of other things to do besides shopping.



Well, shopping in a mall is certainly entertaining and has several advantages. However, I think it 's important to support small local shops, as well. I believe you get better service in your neighbourhood stores. At a mall, the shops are mostly international chain stores and a lot of the products are imported.



Would you like to live in yout hometown for the rest of your life?

I am very happy where I live, as my neighborhood is a quiet one but never dull. There are lots of shops and many restaurants and coffee shops. It is close to the city center but far away from all the noise and crowds. </div></th>
